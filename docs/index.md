There are three main features CourseCake offers that make university course information more "edible" for developers:
- 🌐 Web API (REST + GraphQL) [coursecake.tisuela.com/api/v1](http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/v1) - [docs](https://docs.coursecake.tisuela.com/REST-API)
- 💾 Database package - [docs](http://docs.coursecake.tisuela.com/Database)
- 🔍 Scraper package - [docs](https://docs.coursecake.tisuela.com/Scrapers)

CourseCake aims to create an API to access course data, where college course information is unified by our schemas. By making course 📚 data easier to responsibly access and more "edible" 🍰 for developers, we hope CourseCake gives a smooth approach to build useful tools for students.
