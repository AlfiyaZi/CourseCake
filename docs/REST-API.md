* Try out our [REST](http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/v1) or [GraphQL](http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/graphql) endpoint.
* Take a look at comprehensive documentation [here](http://coursecake.tisuela.com)


## [GraphQL](http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/graphql) - Beyond REST
[coursecake.tisuela.com/api/graphql](http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/graphql) is another Web API endpoint (it is not RESTful) for queries via GraphQL.

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs. It allows for more dynamic, specific queries, helping CourseCake give you the information you need. However, the kind of requests you will have to make are more complex.

You can see our GraphQL Schema documentation and **try it out live** on our [GraphiQL browser](http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/graphql).

### All courses
üìö `GET /courses/all/<university>`

Returns all courses from a university.
`university` is determined by their domain.edu.

### Search Courses
üîç `GET courses/search/<university>`

Query our database for courses


#### Create complex queries
üî¨ All parameter names can be followed by [filter]. This allows for powerful queries, allowing us to query Course information *for you*.
The default filter (applied when no filter is specified) is `equals`.

For example:
```
title[like]=dance
```

Here are all valid filters:
`like`
`notlike`
`equals`
`not`

You can search for multiple values for a parameter by separating them with commas:
```
/courses/search/<university>?units=4,8&department[not]=compsci,biosci
```

Here are the supported search parameters:

Parameter |  Description
--- | ---
"id" | Course id, like DANCE 101
"units" |
"department" | See Department codes on your school's Course Schedule
"title" | Readable name, like Intro to Dance


Here's a request that returns all of UCI's in-person classes taught on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday which are not taught by Professor Badprof
```
GET coursecake.tisuela.com/api/v1/classes/search/uci?location[notlike]=line,remote,tba&time[like]=mwf&instructor=goodprof
```

## Quickstart
Lets search for all the courses in a university. Note that we specify a `limit` in each request; the default `limit` is 50 results per request. This is to prevent API abuse.

### Python
You will need the `requests` library. To install, run on you command line: `python -m pip install requests`
```
import requests

# URL to the Search API endpoint
url = "http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/v1/courses/search/uci"   

# send request
response = requests.get(url, params=search_params)

# view body of response
print(response.text)

# get the courses JSON
courses_json = response.json()
```

### Curl
```
curl http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/v1/courses/search/uci
```


## Complex Examples
The below examples show how to create complex, powerful queries to our REST API.

Each case is the same. We search for `courses` at `UCI` that are within a `department` which contains (`like`) `comp` or `bio`. Next, we look for `courses` that have a `title` which does `not` match `intro to bad course`. Finally, only courses with `units` that `equal` `4` are returned.

### Python
You will need the `requests` library. To install, run on you command line: `python -m pip install requests`
```
import requests

# URL to the Search API endpoint
url = "http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/v1/courses/search/uci"    

# search parameters for the GET request
search_params = {

    # courses which contain "comp" OR "bio"
    "department[like]": "comp,bio",

    # courses with a title that does NOT MATCH "intro to bad course"
    "title[not]": "intro to bad course",

    # courses with units that EQUAL 4
    "units": "4"
}

# send request
response = requests.get(url, params=search_params)

# get the courses JSON
courses_json = response.json()
```

### Curl
```
curl http://coursecake.tisuela.com/api/v1/courses/search/uci?department[like]=comp,bio&title[not]=intro%20to%20bad%20course&units=4
```

## Course vs Class
üìö A `Course` is a unit of teaching that lasts a term.

üìù A `Class` is an offering of a `Course`. This means a `Class` has information for the purpose of enrollment and meaning, such as  instructor, meeting times, location, and status (open or closed). A `Course` has many `classes`, however each `Class` belongs to exactly one `Course`.


### Course Schema
üìö This defines a `Course` as a response from our REST API and GraphQL Web API, the model in `database.models`, and the class in `scrapers.course`.
s
Below is an example:
```
{
"course_id": "string",
"title": "string",
"department": "string",
"units": 4,
"prerequisites_str": "string",
"department_title": "string",
"restrictions": "string",
"school": "string",
"provider": "SlugSurvival",
"university_name": "UCI",
"term_id": "FALL-2020-1",
"updated": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
"classes": [ ]
}

```

### Class Schema
üìù This defines a `Class` as a response from our REST API and GraphQL Web API, the model in `database.models`, and the class (renamed `CourseClass`) in `scrapers.course_class`.

Looking at our source code, you see names like `CourseClass` or `a_class`. This naming prevents collisions with each other and with the python-built in blueprint for objects: `class`.

Below is an example:
```
{
"class_id": "string",
"course_id": "string",
"instructor": "string",
"time": "string",
"location": "string",
"building": "string",
"room": "string",
"status": "string",
"type": "string",
"units": 4,
"max": 0,
"enrolled": 0,
"waitlisted": 0,
"requested": 0,
"provider": "SlugSurvival",
"university_name": "UCI",
"term_id": "FALL-2020-1",
"updated": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
"course": {}
}
```
