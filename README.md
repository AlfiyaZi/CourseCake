# CourseCake - Our Aim
At the end of the day all courses are... Courses. Every college course shares similar attributes: instructors, course name, units, etc. Therefore, we aim to scrape college course website to create an API where all course data can be accessed, where each college course shares the same basic, expected data. By making course data easier to access and more "edible" for programs, we hope CourseCake gives a smoother approach build useful tools for students. 

There are two main features to CourseCake to accomplish this goal:
- RESTful API (current not online but in development)
- Installable Scraper package

## What is a Course?
Here is an example response from our online Flask API endpoint
```
{
  "courses": [
    {
      "code": "01020",
      "department": "Art",
      "departmentTitle": "Art",
      "enrolled": 72,
      "instructor": "MAJOLI, M.BORNSTEIN, J.",
      "location": "VRTL REMOTE",
      "max": 160,
      "name": "Art 1A",
      "requested": 0,
      "restrictions": "",
      "school": "Claire Trevor School of the Arts",
      "status": "NewOnly",
      "time": "TBA",
      "title": "ART IN CONTEXT",
      "type": "Lec",
      "units": 4,
      "waitlisted": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

The breakdown of a course from the JSON response is analogous to the definition of a `Course` in `coursecake/scrapers/course.py`:

Key/Attribute | Value
--- | ---
"code" | String
"department" | String       
"departmentTitle" | String
"enrolled" | String
"instructor" | String
"location" | String
"max" | int
"name" | String
"requested" | int
"restrictions" | String
"school" | String
"status" | String
"time" | String
"title" | String
"type" | String
"units" | int
"waitlisted" | int




## UC Irvine -- Zot your courses easier and responsibly
CourseCake was inspired to make it easier to develop tools like AntPlanner and Antscoper, and promote a responsible use of WebSoc by not abusing its resources.

All of the latest scraped data is stored in a local database, which avoids congesting WebSoc and allows successful requests even when WebSoc is down.

Endpoints that do query WebSoc are ratelimited and follow usage rates similar to other UCI Irvine course helper wesbites.



## Installation

#### Clone repository
`git clone https://github.com/nananananate/CourseScraper`

#### Create Python virtual environment

There are a good amount of depencies for this project -- it will be good practice to use a virtual environment, albeit not necessary.

On macOS and Linux:
```
python3 -m venv env
```

On Windows:
```
py -m venv env
```
The second argument is the location to create the virtual environment. Generally, you can just create this in your project and call it env.


#### Activate virtual encironment
On macOS and Linux:
```
source env/bin/activate
```
On Windows Command Line:
```
.\env\Scripts\activate.bat
```
One Windows Powershell
```
.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

#### Navigate to the repository folder and install packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt`





# Documentation
## RESTful API

Currently not available online. See below for deploying the Flask Web App locally.


### `/api/uci/courses/all`
Returns all UCI courses

### `/api/uci/courses/search`
Query our database for courses

Here are the supported search parameters:
Paramaeter | Value | Comments
--- | --- | ---
"code" | String | Search by course code (returns one course)
"department" | Search by department (See department codes on WebSoc)
"instructor" | String | Search by instructor
"units" | String or int | Search courses with matching units
"building" | String | Search by building 
"notlocation" | String | Excludes courses in particular building/room
"notinstructor" | String 
Usage:
```
/api/uci/courses/search?instructor=pattis&units=4&department=compsci

/api/uci/courses/search?notinstructor=badprof&notlocation=badlocation
```

### `/api/uci/courses/live-search`
Queries courses retrieved directly from the univerisiy's course scheduling website.
Same usage as `/api/uci/courses/search`.

Here are the supported search parameters:
Paramaeter | Value
--- | ---
"code" | String
"department" | String       
"instructor" | String
"breadth" | String
"starttime" | String (ex: 8:00am)
"endtime" | String (ex: 8:00am)
"title" | String
"units" | String or int

You must specify one of the following parameters: `code`, `department`, `instructor`, or `breadth`




## CourseScraper `coursecake.scrapers.course_scraper`

Importing CourseScraper:
```
from coursecake.scrapers.course_scraper import CourseScraper
```

### `CourseScraper.getAllUciCourses() -> dict`

From CourseScraper, you can load all UCI courses as a dictionary of `Course`
Usage:
```
scraper = CourseScraper()
courses = scraper.getAllUCICourses()
```
Courses are loaded in chunks; it will take a minute for all courses to be collected.

### `CourseScraper.getCourses(args: dict) -> dict`

Get the latest course information (directly scraped from web) on courses fulfilling search criteria.
`args` is a `dict` in which you specify search parameters and their values. 

Here are the currently supported arguments: 

Key | Value
--- | ---
"code" | String
"department" | String       
"instructor" | String
"breadth" | String
"starttime" | String (ex: 8:00am)
"endtime" | String (ex: 8:00am)
"title" | String
"units" | String or int

You must specify one of the following parameters: `code`, `department`, `instructor`, or `breadth`

Example usage:
```
args = {
  "department': "compsci",
  "units": 4
  }

courses = scraper.getCourses(args)
```




## Course `coursecake.scrapers.course`
A `Course` object holds all information you can get on a course, accessible by attributes (ex: `Course.instructor`).
You can easily serialize a `Course` using `Course.__dict__`

`courses` is a list of `Course` objects, ad defined in `coursecake/scrapers/course.py`. From the `Course` object, you can get obtain the course's data.

Here is an example of printing some course data from `courses`
```
for course in courses:

  # This does not print out all attributes, just a select few to avoid clutter
  # see more in Course.__str__(self)
  print(course)

  # print the status of the course; if it is open, closed, full, etc.
  print(course.status)
```

To save all UCI courses into a JSON file:
```
scraper.downloadUCICourses()
```

The format of data within the JSON file is a dictionary of `Course.__dict__`, where `Course.code` are the keys.


## Deploy Flask Application locally


#### Run flask
For Linux and Mac:

```
export FLASK_APP=coursecake/flaskapp
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

For Windows cmd, use set instead of export:

```
set FLASK_APP=coursecake/flaskapp
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

For Windows PowerShell, use $env: instead of export:

```
$env:FLASK_APP = "coursecake/flaskapp"
$env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
flask run
```

Youâ€™ll see output similar to this:

```
* Serving Flask app "coursecake/flaskapp"
* Environment: development
* Debug mode: on
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
* Restarting with stat
* Debugger is active!
* Debugger PIN: 855-212-761
```
